        <h2>Citywide Composting Initiative</h2>
        <p>
            Jacksonville ran a composting pilot program in Riverside and Avondale, showing promise in reducing landfill waste by composting organic material like food scraps and yard waste. Unfortunately, after the pilot ended, the city left it up to private companies to continue without long-term funding or expansion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Composting would significantly reduce our landfill use, cut greenhouse gas emissions, and improve our recycling systems by decreasing contamination from food waste. Cities like Seattle and San Francisco have seen success with similar programs. It’s time for Jacksonville to invest in a citywide, sustained composting effort that reaches all households and businesses.

        <h2>Plastic Bag Ban Initiative</h2>
        <p>
            Plastic pollution is one of the biggest environmental challenges facing Jacksonville. With our proximity to the St. Johns River and the Atlantic Ocean, plastic bags threaten our marine life and ecosystems. Many cities have already banned single-use plastic bags, reducing waste, protecting wildlife, and saving millions in clean-up costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jacksonville has the opportunity to do the same by banning plastic bags and encouraging the use of reusable alternatives. Cities like San Francisco and Washington, D.C. have proven that these bans can reduce plastic waste significantly while fostering more sustainable habits among residents.
